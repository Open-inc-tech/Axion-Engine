# Axion Engine

**Axion Engine** is a customized and extended version of the original [GamePlus-Editor](https://github.com/IndividualCoder/GamePlus-Editor), tailored specifically for the needs of **Noxarion Studio**. This version of the engine is being actively used as the foundation for all future 3D game projects developed by our team.

## 🚀 About

Axion Engine is a beginner-friendly, open-source 3D game engine built in Python. It combines the power of the [Ursina Engine](https://www.ursinaengine.org/) with a visual editor, allowing you to create 3D games with minimal coding.

> **Note:** This engine is specially modified to suit the internal workflows and tools of Noxarion Studio. While it inherits much from GamePlus-Editor, it introduces a number of improvements, simplifications, and enhancements.
